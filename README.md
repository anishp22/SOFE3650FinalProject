<h2>Project Proposal</h2>

    The Project Proposal PDF contains a brief overview of the project. 
    It also contains a list of functional and non-functional requirements for the software.

<h2>Project Progress Report</h2>
The Project Progress Report PDF contains following artifacts:


* [Use Case Model](System%20Requirements/Use%20Case%20Model.pdf)
    * Shows the most relevant use cases for the project and is further described in a table
* [Quality Attributes](System%20Requirements/Quality%20Attributes.pdf)
    * The five most relevant quality attributes are also presented in a table with a description and associated use case
* [System Constraints](System%20Requirements/System%20Constraints.pdf)
    * The derived system constraints on the system were collected and shown in a table


<h1>Iteration 1: Establishing an Overall System Structure</h1>

This section contains the results of the activites that are performed in each of the steps of ADD in the first iteration of the design process. 
 
The pdf file with the full report on iteration 1 can be found here. <--- INSERT LINK TO FOLDER 1

<h2>Step 2: Establish Iteration Goal by Selecting Drivers</h2>


This iteration is driven by a general architectural concern, but the following drivers that may influence the general structure of the system should also be acknowledged:
    -QA-1: Performance
    -QA-2: Usability
    -QA-3: Availability
    -QA-4: Security
    -QA-5: Modifiability
    -CON-1: System should be accessible using a web browser on different platforms (OSX, Windows, Linux)
    -CON-2: A minimum of 1000 users should be supported
    -CON-4: Database should be created using MySQL
    -CRN-1: Establishing an initial system structure
